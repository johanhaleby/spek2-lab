# Spek2 Lab

This lab is about getting to know [Spek2](https://www.spekframework.org/) for writing tests in Kotlin. You can decide yourself if you prefer to use [Gherkin](https://www.spekframework.org/gherkin/) or [Specification](https://www.spekframework.org/specification/) style.

Before starting make sure to install the Intellij Plugin, follow instructions [here](https://www.spekframework.org/running/#ide).

You should familiarize yourself with the [domain model](https://github.com/johanhaleby/spek2-lab/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/se/haleby/lab/spek2/rps) then start writing awesome tests. Pair up with a colleague! Teams may consider spreading out in different rooms to avoid interfering with each other.

Maybe there is a bug lurking around somewhere as well? Bonus points for spotting and fixing it :)

Are the test getting long and awkward? Have a look in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file, maybe there's something that can help there? :)

Each group should think and reflect about these things during the lab:

1. How do you write good tests?
2. Do you need mocking? Why (not)?
3. Do you need to write integration tests?
4. Do you need to mess around with Hibernate?
5. How does Spek compare to JUnit?
6. Do you prefer Spek to JUnit?
7. Which Spek style did you chose? Why?
8. Any other reflections?

Note that it's not allowed to drink Sk√•nerost or use Autogiro during this lab.
