# Spek2 Lab

This lab is about getting to know [Spek2](https://www.spekframework.org/) for writing tests in Kotlin.
You can decide yourself if you prefer to use [Gherkin](https://www.spekframework.org/gherkin/) or [Specification](https://www.spekframework.org/specification/) style.

You should familiarize yourself with the [domain model](https://github.com/johanhaleby/spek2-lab/tree/main/src/main/kotlin/se/haleby/lab/spek2/rps) then start writing
awesome tests. Pair up with a colleague!

Maybe there is a bug lurking around as well? Bonus points for spotting it and fixing it :)

Note that it's not allowed to drink Sk√•nerost during this lab.
